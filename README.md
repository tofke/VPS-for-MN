# VPS-for-MN
Virtual Private Server setup for hosting "Dash/PIVX like" Master Nodes

## secure access :
1) create a user : 
```
useradd -m -s /bin/bash username
```
2) add in sudo group : 
```
usermod -g username -G sudo username
```
3) check connection with that user (connect with ssh from wherever you want)

4) if the connexion with your new user works, then disable root login :
```
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
=> change "PermitRootLogin" to "no"

## install dependencies : 
```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libssl1.0.0 libboost-system1.58.0 libboost-program-options1.58.0 libboost-thread1.58.0 libboost-chrono1.58.0 libdb4.8++
sudo apt install libzmq5 libboost-filesystem1.58.0 libboost-program-options1.58.0 libdb4.8++ libminiupnpc10
```
### optionnal (but recommended) :
1) Add some components used by most of the masternode software (unless you compile yourself, then you probably know what you do and won't need this documentation). Always refer to the dev team install notice when possible for needed dependencies.
```
sudo apt install libminiupnpc10 
sudo apt install libdb4.8 
sudo apt install qt protobuf libqrencode 
```
* libminiupnpc10 : firewall-jumping support
* libdb4.8 : needed if wallet enabled
* qt protobuf libqrencode : needed if gui enabled

2) Add some swap space (virtual memory on disk like 'pagefile.sys' on Windows) : 
```
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo echo "/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0" >> /etc/fstab
```
Depending on your needs, you could add more or less swap : 4G stands for 4 GigaBytes, so if for example you just want a 2 Gb swapfile you would have typed "fallocate -l 2G /swapfile" instead.

3) Tell Linux kernel not to swap unless necessary, for example in case of RAM shortage under 10% :  
Check current settings with "sysctl -a|grep swappiness", and if needed change it :
```
sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
```
=> add "vm.swappiness=10" at the end of the file, and run this comand : 
```
sudo sysctl -p
```
This last command should answer with the changed parameter, for example : 
```
root@mn1:~# sysctl -p
vm.swappiness = 10
```

3) Add some more tools to ease administration : 
```
sudo apt install htop glances byobu -y
```
* htop : a better top with easy viewable ressource usage
* glances : an even better tool to view ressources "at a glance" (hence the name, comes from HP-UX 'glance' tool)
* byobu : a better 'screen' (a terminal multiplexer, wich allow to keep a detached session in backgroud or share your screen with multiple sessions)

### Tools for Windows (for remote administration of your VPS)
* MobaXterm : the best Xwindows / SSH client (and much more) i know for Windows : https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html
